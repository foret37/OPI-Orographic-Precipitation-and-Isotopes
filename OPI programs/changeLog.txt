Change Log, for OPI prorams
Mark Brandon, Yale University, 2016 to 2022

v. 3.6 July 24, 2022
       Modified the termination criterion so 
       mSet = mu*(nParametersFree + 1), 
       mu0 = mu, and 
       epsilon = stdev(F_searchSet).

v. 3.6 August 8, 2021
       Leeside calculation had an error, now fixed, where fP was left everywhere equal 
       to 1, rather than being set to the candidate value, fP0, prescribed for each 
       step of the search. This error has likely been active since 
       March 23, 2021 (OPI 3.5).

v. 3.6 July, 2021 
       1) Converted calculation so that d2H is used as basis, rather d180. 
       2) Set getInput so that all isotope samples are input from data file,
       and the selection between primary and altered samples is done internal to 
       program. The altered isotope samples are also saved as separate variables. 
       3) Removed regional evaporation, and set so that evaporation 
       options are automatically accounted for. 
       5) Added a plot to show how dExcess varies as a function of the elevation
       of liftMax relative to the sample elevation. 
       5) Added a map showing relative humidity at the ground. 
       6) Removed penalty option for dry samples. 

v. 3.5 Sept - Dec, 2020: Adopted wind-oriented grids for all calculation,
       and converted to the anelastic, saturated Euler equations of 
       Durran and Klemp, 1982. Also includes options for regional or
       leeside evaporation. 
       Jan - Feb, 2021: Introduced lee-side evaporation. Corrected bugs associated
       with evaporation calculation. Improved representation of temperature field.
       Replaced parameter NS, the buoyancy frequency, with M, the mountain-height index.
       Modified zero-padding in fourierSolution, from 2*nS x 2*nT, to 2*nS x nT. 
       Modified opiMaps (both one wind and two winds) so that the gray color scale 
       for cloud water density starts at 1e-2*max(rhoC). Fixed an error with the
       time delays, which were operating backwards. 
       
v. 3.4 July 2019: Introduced "two winds" version, which will be 
       developed in parallel with the "one wind" version. 
       Sept 26, 2019: Search is now based on a generalized objective 
       function, which accounts for the misfit, as measured by 
       chiR2, and an optional penalty function. The penalty function 
       is used here to test best-fit solutions that have a 
       a large fraction of dry samples. 
v. 3.2 (OneWind) modify to account for catchment above each sample 
       location,removed weights, fixed liftingMax to works with any 
       wind direction. fminCRS3 is now using omega = 1000 to ensure 
       better convergence. Input data should now use cosine taper 
       remove edge effects for topographic data.
v. 3.1 combines 3.0.4 and 3.0.5, and includes some improvements
       and modifications. 
v. 3.0.5 accounts for evaporative recycling from the ground with n = 1, 
       and direct fit of d2H0 and d18O0, 
       inverse probability weighting (IPW), Si functions
       from Ciais and Jouzel (1994), tauF is set by mean fall height,
       and weighted orthogonal least squares (WOLS) for MWL,
       and covariance weighting for residuals.
v. 3.0.4 accounts for evaporative recycling from the ground with n = 1, 
       and also uses d2H0 and d18O0 as set by empirical function of T0, 
       inverse probability weighting (IPW), Si functions
       from Ciais and Jouzel (1994), tauF is set by mean fall height,
       and weighted orthogonal least squares (WOLS) for MWL,
       and covariance weighting for residuals.
v. 3.0.3 accounts for evaporative recycling from the ground with n = 1, 
       and also uses d2H0 and d18O0 as set by empirical function of T0, 
       inverse probability weighting (IPW), Si functions
       from Ciais and Jouzel (1994), tauF is set by mean fall height,
       and weighted orthogonal least squares (WOLS) for MWL,
       and misfit based on WOLS relative to the best-fit MWL.
v. 3.0.2 same as 3.0.0 but with evaporative exponent n = 0.5.
v. 3.0.1 same as 3.0.0 but with evaporative exponent n = 0.5, and 
       directly fitting for d2H0 and d18O0.
v. 3.0.0 accounts for evaporative recycling from the ground, and also
       uses d2H0 and d18O0 as set by empirical function of T0, 
       inverse probability weighting (IPW), Si functions
       from Ciais and Jouzel (1994), tauF is set by mean fall height,
       and Deming regression for MWL with lambda = 64.
v. 2.9 ignoring locations with rP=0, equal weighting, 
       d2H0 and d18O0 set by f(T0), tauF set by mean fall height. 
v. 2.8 two precipitation states, d2H0 and d18O0 set by f(T0), 
       tauF set by mean fall height.
v. 2.7.2 using Deming regression for MWL, and lambda = 64
v. 2.7.1 using Deming regression for MWL, and lambda = 1
v. 2.7 d2H0 and d18O0 set by f(T0), tauF set by mean fall height, 
       and using all samples. 
v. 2.6 fit for a mix of two precipitation states.
v. 2.5 fit for tauC, but fix tauF for mean fall height, and
       uses all samples.
v. 2.4 fit for tauC, but fix tauF for mean fall height, and  
       ignores samples with predicted rP = 0, equal weighting.
v. 2.3 fit ignores samples with predicted rP = 0, equal weighting.
v. 2.2 fits for d2H0 and d18O0 directly.
v. 2.1 uses empirical relationships for d2H0 and d18O0 as function of T0
v. 2.0 accounts for crosswind gradient in water isotopes
v. 1.9 uses inverse probability weighting (IPW), and 
       custom two-term Si functions, and fits for:
       U, azimuth, T0, M, kappa, tau, d2H0, d18O0
July 6, 2014: first working version with relatively slow isotope integration
July 13, 2014: faster isotope integration, along with other improvements.
Oct 5, 2014: fixed error with assigning correct roots for sqrt(m^2)
Oct 28, 2014: turned off ylabel function for colorbars due to an
               incompatibility with Matlab 2014b
Nov 27, 2014: added eddy diffusion and time delay for isotopes
